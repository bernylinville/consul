# Color Swatches

All colors for the immediate future should _mostly_ use the following `tone`
CSS properties, unless:

1. We get around to eventually adding semantic colors names (or adding something else) in which case these docs should be updated.
2. You are absolutely sure the color you want should never be changed by a theme. For example a shadow color probably should always be a shade of gray/black. These should be very very few and far between so even if we get that wrong it should be easy to update.

`tones` should always using the following form:

```css
property: rgb(var(--tone-gray-500));
```

In other words always use `rgb` this gives us the flexibility to easily use thee variables with alpha if we ever need to.

```css
property: rgb(var(--tone-gray-500) / 50);
```

Currently this is mainly used for shadows. Please consider whether you should be using an alpha before using an alpha'ed color.

```hbs preview-template
<ul
  {{css-props (set this 'props')}}
>
{{#each-in this.props as |prop value|}}
{{#if (string-starts-with prop '--tone-')}}
  <li>
    {{#each-in value as |prop value|}}
    <figure
      {{with-copyable (concat "rgb(var(" prop "));")}}
      style={{concat "background-color: rgb(" value ")"}}
    >
      <figcaption>{{prop}}</figcaption>
    </figure>
    {{/each-in}}
  </li>
{{/if}}
{{/each-in}}
</ul>
```
